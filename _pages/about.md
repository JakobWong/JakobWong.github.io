I'm a Data Visualization Ph.D. student at Arizona State University working with [Chris Bryan](chrisbryan.github.io).

My research focuses on designing and developing interfaces to help **non-experts** understanding machine learning models, especially **deep neural networks**. I also apply **immersive technologies** to enhance sense-making in **data analytics**.

I have collaborated with physicians, developers, designers and scientists from <img src="assets/img/pch-logo.png" style="padding: 0px 5px 0px 5px" height="15"> Phoenix Children's Hospital,
