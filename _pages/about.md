I'm a PhD student at **HKUST** focusing on **Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision**. My research bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI research and real-world production systems.

My work spans **LLM agents**, **multimodal perception**, and **ML system optimization**. I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that can reason, learn, and adapt in complex environments.

Previously, I worked at **Intel** on ML model optimization and at **USC Institute for Creative Technologies** on multimodal AI systems. I hold a Master's degree from USC with focus on Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
